# üöó Uber Ride Analytics 2024

This project explores Uber's 2024 ride dataset to uncover patterns in
bookings, cancellations, revenue streams, and customer/driver
behaviors.\
Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw trip data into actionable insights
that highlight efficiency, customer trends, and operational challenges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üõ†Ô∏è The Data

The dataset contained **148,770 bookings** with features like:

-   Booking ID, Date, Time\
-   Booking Status (Completed, Cancelled by Customer, Cancelled by
    Driver, etc.)\
-   Vehicle Type (Auto, Go Mini, Go Sedan, UberXL, Premier Sedan,
    eBike/Bike)\
-   Pickup & Drop Locations\
-   Ride Distance, Fare (Booking Value)\
-   Payment Method (UPI, Cash, Wallet, Credit/Debit Card)\
-   Customer & Driver Ratings

After cleaning and engineering, I created:

‚úÖ Success Rate % (Completed rides vs Total)\
‚úÖ Cancellation Flags (Customer / Driver initiated)\
‚úÖ Revenue Distribution by Payment Method\
‚úÖ Top Customers by Booking Value

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîç The Exploratory Journey

1.  **Booking Patterns**
    -   Total rides: **148.77K**\
    -   Success rate: **65.96% (93K completed rides)**\
    -   Cancellations: **25% (37.43K rides)**
2.  **Customer vs Driver Cancellations**
    -   Customers canceled \~**19%** of rides (often due to wrong
        address or driver delays).\
    -   Drivers canceled \~**7.5%** of rides (capacity issues, car
        problems, or customer-related issues).
3.  **Revenue Insights**
    -   **UPI** dominated as the top payment method (\~40% of revenue).\
    -   Cash contributed \~25%, while credit/debit cards were less
        used.\
    -   The **Top 5 customers** alone generated \~20K in bookings.
4.  **Vehicle Fleet Performance**
    -   **Auto & Go Mini** had the highest ride volumes.\
    -   **UberXL & Premier Sedan** catered to premium customers but with
        lower frequency.\
    -   Ride distances were stable (\~26 km average across vehicle
        types).
5.  **Ratings Analysis**
    -   Customers rated drivers consistently high (avg **4.40+**).\
    -   Drivers rated customers slightly lower (\~**4.23--4.24**).\
    -   Best performing segment: **Go Sedan** (highest customer rating).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìä Power BI Dashboard

I designed an interactive **Power BI dashboard** with multiple views:

-   **Overall Snapshot**: Total bookings, success vs cancellations.\
-   **Vehicle Type Analysis**: Ride distribution & performance.\
-   **Revenue Explorer**: Breakdown by payment method + Top customers.\
-   **Cancellations Deep Dive**: Customer vs driver behavior patterns.\
-   **Ratings Tracker**: Customer vs driver satisfaction.

üëâ Users can filter by **date, vehicle type, or booking status** to
instantly see operational patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° Key Insights

-   **UPI is Uber's backbone** in India ‚Üí \~40% of all revenue.\
-   **Cancellations are a major risk** (1 in 4 rides never completes).\
-   **Customer dissatisfaction** peaks at mid-distance rides (wrong
    address, driver delays).\
-   **Premium vehicles** (UberXL, Premier Sedan) contribute less volume
    but higher average fares.\
-   Ratings are stable ‚Üí trust in platform remains strong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Impact & Why It Matters

This analysis shows how **ride-sharing data tells a story beyond
trips**.

-   Uber can **optimize driver allocation** to reduce cancellations.\
-   Focusing on **payment preferences** (UPI adoption) can improve cash
    flow efficiency.\
-   Identifying **high-value customers** supports loyalty strategies.\
-   Monitoring **driver vs customer satisfaction** ensures long-term
    trust in the platform.

For me, this project was more than dashboards.\
It was about **transforming raw rides into insights** that drive better
decision-making in the mobility industry.

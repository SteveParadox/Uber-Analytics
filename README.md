## 📂 Featured Projects  

### 1. 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics & Attrition Prediction (2025)  
**Objective:** Help an MNC understand **attrition risks** and improve workforce planning.  

**Dataset:** 23,000+ employee records with demographics, tenure, performance, salaries.  

**Key Steps:**  
- Cleaned & transformed HR data → exported as `HR_cleaned.csv`.  
- Engineered features: tenure, attrition flags, salary brackets, performance KPIs.  
- Built ML models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) → **80% accuracy** in predicting resignations.  
- Designed **Power BI dashboard**:  
  - Workforce composition (Active/Resigned/Retired)  
  - Department headcount  
  - Attrition probability by job role, tenure, performance  
  - Hiring trends over time  

**Insights Delivered:**  
- Early-tenure employees (≤2 years) had the **highest attrition risk**.  
- Sales & Operations saw **25% higher attrition** compared to Engineering.  
- Performance rating and salary fairness strongly linked to resignation probability.
